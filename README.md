### Ahoy hoy

I am Ben

I like skiing, running (more wonky and infrequent jogging really), and writing code that looks better than my running does. Neoviming since '01, with a very prime-inspired config that can be found [here](https://github.com/HactuallyBenji/neovimrc).

<br>

I like deep neural nets, thinking about digitized intelligence and numpy.

I do quite like Go, not just for the cute gopher, and think I might start falling more rapidly into the inescapable land of OCaml. Pop!_OS mostly, but sometimes macOS with iTerm2, and even Windows to satiate my Baldur's Gate vice.

At work I'm all Java, Spring, and Kubernetes on Azure.
